# <b>Introduction:</b>
Elderly individuals often use a cane to help maintain balance when walking; however, when they do not need the cane at a given moment, it will frequently fall onto the ground unless leaned on another object. The goal is to create a device that maintains a stable vertical orientation by using a dual axis reaction wheel set up. The system will be able to counteract an external force that would cause the system to fall over. 
For simplicity, the system will use a single Inertial Wheel Pendulum to investigate and model the given scenario.
 
 
 A capabilites database, functional viewpoint, and proposed machine design were created. This step is critical in the Control System Design process where the intial steps to all projects is to establish goals, potential variables, and specifications of the system. The following pictures will reflect the Capabilies Database, functional viewpoint, and proposed machine design repectively.
