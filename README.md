-Problem Statement-

Elderly individuals often use a cane to help maintain balance when walking; however, when they do not need the cane at a given moment, it will frequently fall onto the ground unless leaned on another object. 

-Project Task-

The goal is to create a device that maintains a stable vertical orientation by using a dual axis reaction wheel set up. The system will be able to counteract an external force that would cause the system to fall over.
